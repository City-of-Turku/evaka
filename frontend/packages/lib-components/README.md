# @evaka/lib-components

React components for all eVaka React-frontends.

## Usage

Add `@evaka/lib-components` as a dependency in your `package.json`
**with a matching version number** in both `package.json` files
(this library's and the app's) -- that's how Yarn workspaces matches
the library to this local one. Specifying a mismatching version number
will result in an attempt to resolve the package in an npm registry.
