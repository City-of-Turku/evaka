# Contribution guide

We appreciate your interest in contributing to this project.
eVaka project is currently in a very active development phase. Due to this, the core development
team may be unable to process or accept any contributions at this stage.

We will establish contribution guidelines regarding e.g. how to create pull requests, what code
conventions to use etc. in the upcoming months. This file will be updated accordingly, once the
team is capable of accepting contributions. Thank you.
